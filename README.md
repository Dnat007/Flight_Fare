### Project started
# Flight Fare Prediction Project

## Overview
The Flight Fare Prediction Project is a machine learning-based application that predicts the priceing of the airlines depend on their routes and location that from where you want to capture the flight and where you have to go and there any stopage in your route. Leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling, this project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing flight price ultimately assisting users in making informed decisions about where to go in the cheapest way.


## Components  
Modules that we have used in the project these modules are :
- **Data Ingestion** Reading the data from the data base. 
- **Data Transformation** How to change the category to numerical, How to handle one hot encoding or label encoding
- **Model_trainer** All the training code over here
    How many different models we have used...
    We will also called our accuracy metrix over here 

## Pipeline
- **train_pipeline** : All the pipeline for the training purpose.
- **predict_pipeline** : All the pipeline for the prediction purpose.

## logger
- Any execution that probably happen we can able to log that particular execution

## Key Features :
- **Data Exploration:** Gain insights into the dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features, correlations, and potential trends.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model capable of estimating flight price based on input features.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Interact with the model through an intuitive user interface that allows users to input restaurant features and receive a predicted rating.

## Demo 


## MLOps and CI/CD
Implementing MLOps ensures a seamless and automated machine learning lifecycle. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate testing, model training, and deployment processes.


- **CI/CD Pipeline:**
The CI/CD pipeline is set up to automatically trigger testing, model training, and deployment steps on each code push.

## AWS Deployment
Deploying the Flight Fare Prediction Project on AWS ensures scalability and accessibility. The application is hosted on an AWS instance for seamless access.
